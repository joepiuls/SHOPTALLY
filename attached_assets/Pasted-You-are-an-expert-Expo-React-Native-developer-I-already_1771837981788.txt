You are an expert Expo React Native developer. I already have a working ShopTally app in this Replit (Expo SDK 52, expo-router, NativeWind v2, PowerSync + @powersync/op-sqlite, Supabase, Zustand, TanStack Query, expo-camera, etc.).

Enhance and extend this existing app with these powerful new features. Keep everything lovable, warm Northern Nigerian style (terracotta #C2410C, sand colors, Poppins font, big buttons, haptics, confetti on sale).

New Seller Features:
- Marketplace tab: Toggle any product to "Sell on Marketplace" (syncs stock automatically)
- Create Ads / Listings: 1-tap from product → add title, short desc, price, photos, location
- Orders Management: New screen "My Marketplace Orders" – New, Accepted, Preparing, Ready, Delivered. Update status with one tap, chat with buyer (WhatsApp deep link)
- Delivery tracking: Simple status + expo-location map
- Shop Customization screen ("My Shop"): Upload logo + hero banner, choose accent color, write bio, set shop slug (e.g. kano-spice-mart), featured products, opening hours, delivery radius

Staff Features:
- Staff login screen (PIN or biometric). Owner can add staff with roles: Cashier, Stock Manager, Delivery Rider
- Activity log for each staff

AI & Smart Features:
- AI Notifications: Daily push like "Rice almost finished – 27 sold today!" or "Aisha buys milk every Friday"
- Future Forecast screen: Sales prediction chart (next 7/30 days) using historical data
- Financial Analysis dashboard: Profit/loss, best sellers, cash flow, simple graphs (victory-native or Recharts for web but keep native)

Admin Features (only for me the owner):
- Hidden "Admin Mode" (long press on logo or secret PIN 1234)
- Full business control: View all shops on platform, approve listings, moderate ads, see total GMV, pending payouts, user support, global reports, suspend shops if needed

Keep full offline-first with PowerSync. Use Supabase for realtime sync and multi-tenancy (shop_id).

Add these packages automatically with npx expo install:
expo-notifications, expo-location, react-native-maps, victory-native, expo-haptics (already have), react-native-paystack-webview, i18next + react-i18next (for Hausa/English)

Update the bottom tabs to include: Home, Products, Marketplace, Orders, Reports, My Shop

Generate clean code, update _layout.tsx, add new screens in app/ folder, update Supabase schema comments for new tables (shops, marketplace_listings, orders, staff, etc.).

Start by showing me the new "My Shop" customization screen and the Marketplace Orders screen. Then continue step by step until the whole upgrade is complete.

Make ShopTally the most valuable all-in-one app for small shops in Northern Nigeria!
