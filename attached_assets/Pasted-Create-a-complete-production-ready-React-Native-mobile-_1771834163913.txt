Create a complete, production-ready React Native mobile app using **Expo SDK 52** (React Native 0.76, Expo Router, NativeWind v2).

App name: **ShopTally**
Tagline: "Offline-first POS & inventory – simple, fast & friendly for small shops in Northern Nigeria 🇳🇬"

Target users: Small shop owners and retailers in Kano, Kaduna, Jos, Maiduguri etc. They speak Hausa + English, use affordable Android phones, have spotty internet, and want something that feels warm, trustworthy, and delightful — like a helpful local friend ("No wahala!").

Make the entire app **LOVABLE**:
- Warm, earthy Northern Nigerian color palette: primary terracotta #C2410C, sand #F5E8C7, gold accent #D97706, deep green #166534, soft dark mode
- Use @expo-google-fonts/poppins (regular + semibold) – large, rounded, highly readable text
- Bold, friendly icons from lucide-react-native
- Big tappable areas (minimum 52dp), high contrast, one-handed friendly
- Delightful micro-moments: expo-haptics on every tap, confetti + heavy success haptic when sale is completed, smooth Reanimated transitions, skeleton loaders
- Optimistic UI everywhere (sale saves instantly even offline)
- Friendly offline banner: "No network? No wahala – everything saves here first! 📶🔄"

Tech stack to use exactly:
- Expo SDK 52 + expo-router
- NativeWind v2 + Tailwind
- @powersync/react-native ~1.30.0 + @powersync/op-sqlite + @op-engineering/op-sqlite
- @supabase/supabase-js for auth & sync
- zustand + @tanstack/react-query
- expo-camera, expo-image-picker, expo-haptics, expo-secure-store, expo-background-fetch, expo-task-manager, react-native-netinfo
- react-native-confetti-cannon, lucide-react-native, dayjs, uuid, react-native-share
- Keep react ^18.3.0 and react-native ^0.76.0

Core features (must have all):
- Bottom tab navigation: Home (dashboard), Products, Sales History, Reports
- Prominent FAB for "New Sale"
- New Sale screen: search products, big numeric keypad, running cart, quick add, calculate change, complete sale with receipt preview
- Product catalog with photo upload (camera/gallery), name, price, stock, low-stock alerts
- Inventory management + quick stock adjustment
- Daily/weekly/monthly sales reports with simple charts
- Share receipt via WhatsApp/PDF
- Simple customer quick ledger (credit sales)
- Full offline-first with PowerSync (auto-sync when back online)
- Secure login (Supabase auth) + biometric hint if possible

Folder structure and code quality must be clean and Expo best practices. Generate the full working app with proper _layout.tsx, app directory, and all screens.

Start by showing me the home/dashboard screen and the New Sale screen with beautiful lovable design. Then continue building the rest step by step.

Make ShopTally the most loved POS app for small shops in the North!
